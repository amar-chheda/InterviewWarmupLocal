## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the application by modifying the Python files:

- `main.py`: Main Streamlit application logic
- `interview_warmup_local/audio/speech_to_text.py`: Speech recognition functionality
- `interview_warmup_local/llm/local_llm.py`: Language model integration for analysis

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file contains important settings for the application. Here are some key configurations you can modify:

### Voice Model

- `model_path`: Path to the voice model file
- `channels`: Number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)
- `sample_rate`: Sample rate for audio processing
- `chunk_size`: Size of audio chunks for processing
- `frames_per_buffer`: Number of frames per buffer for audio processing
- `model_type`: Type of model (e.g., "vosk", "whisper")

Example configuration:

```yaml
voice_model:
  model_path: "/path/to/model"
  channels: 1
  sample_rate: 16000
  chunk_size: 4096
```

### LLM (Language Model)

- `model`: Name or path of the language model to use (e.g., "eramax/fusechat-7b-varm")
- `request_timeout`: Timeout for LLM requests in seconds (e.g., 320.0)
- `chunk_size`: Size of text chunks for processing (e.g., 512)
- `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between text chunks (e.g., 75)
- `embed_model`: Name of the embedding model to use (e.g., "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")
- `prompt_template`: Custom prompts for analysis
  - `overall_analysis`: Template for overall interview analysis
  - `question_analysis`: Template for individual question analysis

Example configuration:

```yaml
llm:
  model: "eramax/fusechat-7b-varm"
  request_timeout: 320.0
  chunk_size: 512
  chunk_overlap: 75
